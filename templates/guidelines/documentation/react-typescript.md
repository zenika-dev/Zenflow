### TSDoc — React Components

Add TSDoc to props interfaces and exported hooks:

```typescript
/**
 * Form for submitting user feedback.
 * Calls POST /api/feedback on submission.
 *
 * @example
 * <FeedbackForm onSuccess={(id) => console.log('Created:', id)} />
 */
interface FeedbackFormProps {
  /** Called with the new record's ID on successful submission */
  onSuccess: (id: number) => void;
  /** If provided, pre-fills the form for editing an existing record */
  initialValues?: Partial<FeedbackRequest>;
}
```
